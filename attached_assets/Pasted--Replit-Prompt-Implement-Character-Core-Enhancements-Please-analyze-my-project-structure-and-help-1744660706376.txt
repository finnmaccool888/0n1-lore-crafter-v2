# Replit Prompt: Implement Character Core Enhancements

Please analyze my project structure and help me implement character core enhancements to my existing character generation system. I need to add more depth to my characters with psychological profiles, origins, relationships, and other elements.

## First Steps:

1. Please analyze my project structure to identify:
   - Where my character model/schema is defined
   - Where character generation logic is implemented
   - Any API endpoints related to character generation
   - The overall architecture of my character system

2. After analysis, show me the relevant files you've found and explain your implementation plan before making changes.

## Implementation Needs:

I need to enhance my characters with the following new sections:

### 1. Psychology Section
```javascript
psychology: {
  personalityType: "", // MBTI or Big Five
  coreValues: [],
  fears: [],
  desires: [],
  innerConflict: "",
  defenseMechanisms: []
}
```

### 2. Origins Section
```javascript
origins: {
  birthplace: "",
  family: "",
  culturalBackground: "",
  formativeEvents: [],
  childhood: ""
}
```

### 3. Relationships Section
```javascript
relationships: {
  allies: [],
  rivals: [],
  mentors: [],
  familyTies: [],
  romanticConnections: []
}
```

### 4. Additional Sections Needed
- Enhanced powers/abilities system
- Narrative elements (unfinished business, secret history)
- Visual identity elements
- Story engine preparation metadata

## Functions to Implement:

1. Functions to generate each new section (generatePsychology, generateOrigins, etc.)
2. Helper functions for each section (determinePersonalityType, generateFears, etc.)
3. Update to the main character generation function to include new components
4. Story engine preparation function to make characters ready for narrative use

## After Implementation:

Once you've implemented these changes:
1. Explain what you've modified and added
2. Show examples of the new character generation in action
3. Suggest any improvements or optimizations

Thank you for your help!
