# Replit Prompt: 0N1 Force Character Lore Generator with Notion Integration

## Project Overview
I'm building a comprehensive character lore generator for the 0N1 Force universe that pulls data from a Notion database containing our world-building elements. This system will allow community-created lore to be continuously integrated and accessible to the generator, ensuring consistency across all media formats (webtoons, games, stories, etc.).

## Primary Goals
1. Create a Notion database connection that syncs world-building content
2. Implement the character generation system from my existing prompt flow
3. Build a story engine foundation that supports cross-media narrative continuity
4. Ensure the system can evolve as new lore elements are added by the community

## Tech Stack Requirements
- Node.js backend
- Notion API integration
- Character generation system
- JSON storage/export capability
- Future extensibility for game engine integration

## Specific Implementation Needs

### 1. Notion Database Integration
Please analyze my project and implement a system that:
- Connects to the Notion API using an integration token
- Pulls world-building data from specified Notion databases
- Caches content locally to reduce API calls
- Implements a regular sync schedule or manual trigger option
- Organizes data into accessible structures for the character generator

### 2. Character Generation System
Implement the character generation flow from my document with these enhancements:
- Store character archetypes with their associated traits and powers
- Connect character generation to world-building elements from Notion
- Implement the psychology, origins, relationships sections as described in the paste.txt file
- Create a JSON export feature for character data
- Add story engine preparation as specified

### 3. Enhanced World-Building Integration
Extend the world-building categories to include:
- **Timeline & Era Tracking**: Historical events and their impact on character generation
- **Faction Dynamics**: Political forces, alliances, and conflicts 
- **Location-Specific Traits**: How birthplace affects character development
- **Cultural Systems**: Traditions, ceremonies, beliefs that shape characters
- **Power Sources & Manifestations**: Detailed mechanics of the One Source
- **Technology & Artifacts**: Notable items and their narrative significance
- **Narrative Themes & Motifs**: Core storytelling elements that repeat across media
- **Story Hooks & Plot Seeds**: Common narrative triggers for character stories
- **Media-Specific Adaptations**: How character elements translate across different media
- **Relationship Networks**: How characters interconnect in the larger universe

### 4. Story Engine Foundation
Build the groundwork for a story engine that can:
- Track narrative continuity across characters and media
- Generate consistent story arcs based on character archetypes
- Map character growth trajectories based on personality and background
- Create conflict scenarios based on world events and character motivations
- Track relationships and interactions between characters over time

## Code Structure Recommendations
Please analyze my existing code first, then suggest a modular architecture that allows for:
1. Separation between data sources (Notion API connection)
2. Character generation logic
3. Story engine components
4. Export/persistence mechanisms
5. Future API endpoints for cross-media integration

## Specific Technical Requirements
- Use the Notion API JavaScript SDK
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Create a caching system to minimize Notion API calls
- Ensure all character data can be exported as JSON
- Document the code extensively for future community contributions
- Add environment variable support for API keys and configuration

## Implementation Steps
1. First analyze my existing project structure and files
2. Outline your proposed implementation approach
3. Create the Notion API connection
4. Implement the character model enhancements
5. Build the generation functions
6. Add the story engine preparation features
7. Create export capabilities
8. Test with sample data
