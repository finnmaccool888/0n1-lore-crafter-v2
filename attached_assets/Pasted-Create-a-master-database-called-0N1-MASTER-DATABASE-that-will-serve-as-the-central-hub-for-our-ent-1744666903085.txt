Create a master database called "0N1 MASTER DATABASE" that will serve as the central hub for our entire 0N1 universe lore system. 

This master database should have the following properties:

1. Component Name (Title): Name of the database or system component
2. Component Type (Select): Character System, World Building, Timeline, Approval Workflow, Technical System, Narrative Elements
3. Description (Text): Brief explanation of what this component does
4. Database Link (URL): Direct link to the associated database
5. Status (Select): Active, In Development, Archived, Pending Review
6. Last Updated (Date): When this component was last modified
7. Responsible Team (Multi-select): Engineering, Lore, Community, Design, Executive
8. Priority Level (Select): Critical, High, Medium, Low
9. Related Components (Relation): Self-relation to connect interdependent systems
10. Technical Documentation (URL): Link to technical documentation if applicable
11. Notes (Text): Additional information about this component

Then, create the following linked views:

1. "Character System Hub" - Filtered to show only components related to character creation, aging system, and character approval flow
2. "World Building Hub" - Filtered to show Enclave, Locations, Factions and other world elements
3. "Timeline System" - Filtered to show all components related to the AI/PI dating system and chronology
4. "Technical Implementation" - Filtered to show the technical components and API integrations
5. "Approval Workflows" - Filtered to show only the approval systems for character canon verification

For the initial database, please create entries for these core components:

1. Character Asymptotic Aging System
2. AI/PI Timeline Correlation System
3. Character Submission Form
4. Character Approval Workflow
5. Notion Integration API
6. Character Lore Generator
7. Canon Verification System
8. Enclave Database
9. Timeline Database
10. Location Database
11. One Source Database
12. Archetypes Database
13. Factions Database
14. Contributors Database

For each entry, please generate a brief description explaining its role in the overall system and how it connects to other components.

Also create a linked database for "System Updates" to track changes to any component with properties for Update Description, Date, Responsible Person, and Affected Components.
